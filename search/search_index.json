If the blacklist app is detected in INSTALLED_APPS , Ninja JWT will add any generated refresh or sliding tokens to a list of outstanding tokens. It will also check that any refresh or sliding token does not appear in a blacklist of tokens before it considers it as valid. The Ninja JWT blacklist app implements its outstanding and blacklisted token lists using two models: OutstandingToken and BlacklistedToken . Model admins are defined for both of these models. To add a token to the blacklist, find its corresponding OutstandingToken record in the admin and use the admin again to create a BlacklistedToken record that points to the OutstandingToken record. Alternatively, you can blacklist a token by creating a BlacklistMixin subclass instance and calling the instance's blacklist method: from ninja_jwt.tokens import RefreshToken token = RefreshToken(base64_encoded_token_string) token.blacklist() This will create unique outstanding token and blacklist records for the token's jti claim or whichever claim is specified by the JTI_CLAIM setting.

ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME A datetime.timedelta object which specifies how long access tokens are valid. This timedelta value is added to the current UTC time during token generation to obtain the token's default exp claim value. REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME A datetime.timedelta object which specifies how long refresh tokens are valid. This timedelta value is added to the current UTC time during token generation to obtain the token's default exp claim value. ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS When set to True , if a refresh token is submitted to the TokenRefreshView , a new refresh token will be returned along with the new access token. This new refresh token will be supplied via a refresh key in the JSON response. New refresh tokens will have a renewed expiration time which is determined by adding the timedelta in the REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME setting to the current time when the request is made. If the blacklist app is in use and the BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION setting is set to True , refresh tokens submitted to the refresh view will be added to the blacklist. BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION When set to True , causes refresh tokens submitted to the TokenRefreshView to be added to the blacklist if the blacklist app is in use and the ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS setting is set to True . You need to add 'ninja_jwt.token_blacklist', to your INSTALLED_APPS in the settings file to use this setting. Learn more about /blacklist_app {.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}. UPDATE_LAST_LOGIN When set to True , last_login field in the auth_user table is updated upon login (TokenObtainPairController). Warning: Updating last_login will dramatically increase the number of database transactions. People abusing the views could slow the server and this could be a security vulnerability. If you really want this, throttle the endpoint. ALGORITHM The algorithm from the PyJWT library which will be used to perform signing/verification operations on tokens. To use symmetric HMAC signing and verification, the following algorithms may be used: 'HS256' , 'HS384' , 'HS512' . When an HMAC algorithm is chosen, the SIGNING_KEY setting will be used as both the signing key and the verifying key. In that case, the VERIFYING_KEY setting will be ignored. To use asymmetric RSA signing and verification, the following algorithms may be used: 'RS256' , 'RS384' , 'RS512' . When an RSA algorithm is chosen, the SIGNING_KEY setting must be set to a string that contains an RSA private key. Likewise, the VERIFYING_KEY setting must be set to a string that contains an RSA public key. SIGNING_KEY The signing key that is used to sign the content of generated tokens. For HMAC signing, this should be a random string with at least as many bits of data as is required by the signing protocol. For RSA signing, this should be a string that contains an RSA private key that is 2048 bits or longer. Since Ninja JWT defaults to using 256-bit HMAC signing, the SIGNING_KEY setting defaults to the value of the SECRET_KEY setting for your django project. Although this is the most reasonable default that Ninja JWT can provide, it is recommended that developers change this setting to a value that is independent from the django project secret key. This will make changing the signing key used for tokens easier in the event that it is compromised. VERIFYING_KEY The verifying key which is used to verify the content of generated tokens. If an HMAC algorithm has been specified by the ALGORITHM setting, the VERIFYING_KEY setting will be ignored and the value of the SIGNING_KEY setting will be used. If an RSA algorithm has been specified by the ALGORITHM setting, the VERIFYING_KEY setting must be set to a string that contains an RSA public key. AUDIENCE The audience claim to be included in generated tokens and/or validated in decoded tokens. When set to None , this field is excluded from tokens and is not validated. ISSUER The issuer claim to be included in generated tokens and/or validated in decoded tokens. When set to None , this field is excluded from tokens and is not validated. JWK_URL The JWK_URL is used to dynamically resolve the public keys needed to verify the signing of tokens. When using Auth0 for example you might set this to ' https://yourdomain.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json '. When set to None , this field is excluded from the token backend and is not used during validation. LEEWAY Leeway is used to give some margin to the expiration time. This can be an integer for seconds or a datetime.timedelta . Please reference https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#expiration-time-claim-exp for more information. USER_ID_FIELD The database field from the user model that will be included in generated tokens to identify users. It is recommended that the value of this setting specifies a field that does not normally change once its initial value is chosen. For example, specifying a username or email field would be a poor choice since an account's username or email might change depending on how account management in a given service is designed. This could allow a new account to be created with an old username while an existing token is still valid which uses that username as a user identifier. USER_ID_CLAIM The claim in generated tokens which will be used to store user identifiers. For example, a setting value of 'user_id' would mean generated tokens include a user_id claim that contains the user's identifier. USER_AUTHENTICATION_RULE Callable to determine if the user is permitted to authenticate. This rule is applied after a valid token is processed. The user object is passed to the callable as an argument. The default rule is to check that the is_active flag is still True . The callable must return a boolean, True if authorized, False otherwise resulting in a 401 status code. AUTH_TOKEN_CLASSES A list of dot paths to classes that specify the types of token that are allowed to prove authentication. More about this in the Token types section below. TOKEN_TYPE_CLAIM The claim name that is used to store a token's type. More about this in the Token types section below. JTI_CLAIM The claim name that is used to store a token's unique identifier. This identifier is used to identify revoked tokens in the blacklist app. It may be necessary in some cases to use another claim besides the default jti claim to store such a value. TOKEN_USER_CLASS A stateless user object which is backed by a validated token. Used only for the experimental JWTTokenUserAuthentication authentication backend. The value is a dotted path to your subclass of rest_framework_simplejwt.models.TokenUser , which also is the default. SLIDING_TOKEN_LIFETIME A datetime.timedelta object which specifies how long sliding tokens are valid to prove authentication. This timedelta value is added to the current UTC time during token generation to obtain the token's default exp claim value. More about this in the Sliding tokens section below. SLIDING_TOKEN_REFRESH_LIFETIME A datetime.timedelta object which specifies how long sliding tokens are valid to be refreshed. This timedelta value is added to the current UTC time during token generation to obtain the token's default exp claim value. More about this in the Sliding tokens section below.

For example, specifying a username or email field would be a poor choice since an account's username or email might change depending on how account management in a given service is designed. This could allow a new account to be created with an old username while an existing token is still valid which uses that username as a user identifier.","title":"USER_ID_FIELD"},{"location":"settings/#user_id_claim","text":"The claim in generated tokens which will be used to store user identifiers.

In a token's payload, its type can be identified by the value of its token type claim, which is token_type by default. This may have a value of access , sliding , or refresh however refresh tokens are not considered valid for authentication at this time. The claim name used to store the type can be customized by changing the TOKEN_TYPE_CLAIM setting. By default, Ninja JWT expects an access token to prove authentication. The allowed auth token types are determined by the value of the AUTH_TOKEN_CLASSES setting. This setting contains a list of dot paths to token classes. It includes the 'ninja_jwt.tokens.AccessToken' dot path by default but may also include the 'ninja_jwt.tokens.SlidingToken' dot path. Either or both of those dot paths may be present in the list of auth token classes. If they are both present, then both of those token types may be used to prove authentication. Sliding tokens Sliding tokens offer a more convenient experience to users of tokens with the trade-offs of being less secure and, in the case that the blacklist app is being used, less performant. A sliding token is one which contains both an expiration claim and a refresh expiration claim. As long as the timestamp in a sliding token\\'s expiration claim has not passed, it can be used to prove authentication. Additionally, as long as the timestamp in its refresh expiration claim has not passed, it may also be submitted to a refresh view to get another copy of itself with a renewed expiration claim. If you want to use sliding tokens, change the AUTH_TOKEN_CLASSES setting to ('ninja_jwt.tokens.SlidingToken',) . (Alternatively, the AUTH_TOKEN_CLASSES setting may include dot paths to both the AccessToken and SlidingToken token classes in the ninja_jwt.tokens module if you want to allow both token types to be used for authentication.) Also, register NinjaJWTSlidingController to the api : from ninja_jwt.controller import NinjaJWTSlidingController from ninja_extra import NinjaExtraAPI api = NinjaExtraAPI() api.register_controllers(NinjaJWTSlidingController) Be aware that, if you are using the blacklist app, Ninja JWT will validate all sliding tokens against the blacklist for each authenticated request.
